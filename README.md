# Employee_Tracker

This application utilizes the node.js package inquirer as well as mysql databases to allow a user to manage databases containing employee and job related information.  The application uses three separate tables within the database: a department table, a job role table, and an employee table.  

When the application is in use, the user has the ability to view any of the 3 above mentioned tables, add a department to the department table, add a job role to the job roles table, add an employee to the employee table, and update an employee's role.  The user is able to select how they would like to proceed in the application, as well as entering inputs for the associated functions, through the use of inquirer prombpts.
